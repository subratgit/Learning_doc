1- Put and Patch Http methods
2- In memeory where does Constuctor and Static variable store
3- JVM structure - class loader, execution engine, GIT compiler, Interceptor,
4- 12 factor(2)
5- CORS- Cross origin configuration(2 times)
6- HLD and LLD - 
7- Domain Driven architecture
8- Vertical scaling and horizantal scaling
	Vertical Scaling - add hardware, cpu, ram
	Horizontal Scaling - add no of instances
	When we need which scaling. 
9- kafka has 5 topics, message distributing to all the topics. How consumer will read sequence messages from all the topics.
10- Heap dump and thread dump
	Heap dump - A snapshot of an application's memory at a specific point in time. It shows what is in memory, the values of those objects, and the size of those objects. Heap dumps can help identify memory leaks and high memory usage.
	Thread dump - Shows what is happening with all the threads in a Java process. Thread dumps can help troubleshoot performance issues, deadlocks, and infinite loops.
11- // can a abstract class have no abstract method, why can not we create object of abstract class , does abstract class has default method
	 Abstract class can have constructor but can not create a object becouse by using object we can not call or use abstract method. So, java does not allow ojcet of Abstract class
12- /// can an interface has wihout no method, // can has only default method
	Yes
13- Why HashTable can not have null key
	HashTable, when putting key value. internally it creates hash of key and check not null value. if Key or value is null it throws NPException

29- kafka connect - can we rename kafka configuratio file (2 times)
30- countdownlatch and cyclicbarrier
31- Race Condition
32- rest idempotent methods (3 times)
	A- HTTP methods that have the same effect on the server, regardless of how many times they are executed. For example, GET, PUT, and DELETE are idempotent methods, because they always return the same resource, update the same resource, or remove the same resource, respectively. On the other hand, POST is not idempotent, because it creates a new resource every time it is called.
33- bounded context
34- strangler pattern  in MS

46- @Transient in entity class
  - which prevent int DB operation. Only for respnse purpose
47- MS-A wants to call a service from MS-B. How will call

	s.add(e1);
	s.add(e1);
	s.size(); ? - 1 or 2? and why?

what is projection in hibernate
what are the cascades
HLD Design - what is CAPIROM and RPO
how the real use of proxy design pattern - behabhiour and structural design pattern
MS - A -> B -> C where we should use Circuit design patterns
	- Ans - we have to declare all microservices(A and B)
how to configure 2 DB and how to identify the transaction to which DB
Your MS(A) call to MS-B, MS-C and MS-D. How to identify which is your own MS and which is external MS(here MS-D)
what are the grant types in Authorizisation, how it validate the token  and where it generate(if you say it is in gateway, how it secure your MS api and external apis)
How you do performance test-
	When you do perofrmance test in locally it was working fine but when you deploy in production, after one month application gives perormance issue
	- Such cases how will you trace which service is giving performance issue and what would you do to resolve the performance issue

postConstruct and EventListener (Answ)

How can we add external properties files in MS other than application.properties(Answer available)

------------
Can we create own marker interface. Who identify marker interface and do the specific work

----------
Emids- 2nd
- what is metasapce in java 8
- How will manage transaction Atomicity - if app calling to service A and then calling to service B and calling to service C. Transaction should be manage atomicity, how will you manage- either all the services or none
- How will be active the Oauth provided token
- @Profile and @Condition annotation in spring
- JPA repository interface has a method annotated as @Query. Method is returning List of Objects.
	How will you manage to get DTO list from that repository query method, so that you no need to convert Object list to DTO list.
	Sould not change in repository query mthod

- Lets say you have build a MS S1. MS has 3 consumer(Client)(C1, C2, C3). It is in production. One point the no of consumer is spiked in C1. The requests coming to C2 and C3 is ignored by the MS S1. This is resulting starvation, the requests coming to C2 and C3. How to handle this type of design - how to address this particular soultion
- Design a micro service which will take input country and currency which will return the current gold price. Initial data will load the start of the day.
	Teke care of below points in design -
	- Only access to registered user
		- Cost effective
		- Scale

Devops --
---------
1- Kubernates - replica set and services 
2- How docker image can get dynamic values
3- How we containerize microservices
4- What if all the nodes goes down(all replica/instances down)
5- How do you ensure the container image is compatible with AWS and Openshift
	- If I created a impage for windows machine, will it work in linux machine
6- How can we create image using maven command

what is docker and its use
if docker image has any issue how to trouble shoot it. how to check trouble should log
how to check health

Kubernates
if you hitting a url how it reaching in pod
ingeess - pod
cluster ip

selector and mess level in kubernates tag- 
pod is working but has issue in pod. pod got deleted how it will agin connect to service

deffrent resources in kubernates - kind of object - pod , configmap, secret
liveness prob and rediness prob

- Communication between namespace pods - A namespace has one pod and B namespace has one pod. how to communicate these pods? is it possible?




In Kubernates, differents instances are created in idfferent pods. Each pod will have different IP address but same port no. IP address range is difined in configuration file.



Design based-
--------------
- One file contains 1 milion recodes, you wat to process in and update in DB - design the efficent way
- ONe application is there you need to implement by looking thread , synchronous and perfromance(multi thread)
- How will manage transaction Atomicity - if app calling to service A and then calling to service B and calling to service C. Transaction should be manage atomicity, how will you manage- either all the services or none
- Lets say you have build a MS S1. MS has 3 consumer(Client)(C1, C2, C3). It is in production. One point the no of consumer is spiked in C1. The requests coming to C2 and C3 is ignored by the MS S1. This is resulting starvation, the requests coming to C2 and C3. How to handle this type of design - how to address this particular soultion
- Design a micro service which will take input country and currency which will return the current gold price. Initial data will load the start of the day.
	Teke care of below points in design -
	- Only access to registered user
		- Cost effective
		- Scale

- What is CQRS design pattern ? - lets say one MS has get api, Post and Put api. can we say this is a CQRS design pattern?




DB-
-------
1- Create customer and cards with issue date schema and make 1-n relation

Customer
Id, Name, address, gender, cardtypeId(Id), issueDate
CardsType
Id, Name, type 

Write query to get list of customer those are holding card for more than 5 years, it is possible that single customer has multiple cards.

Senarios -
 - customer name can be same but they actualy two customer
 - 

select distinct c.name c.id ,c.name , c.address, d.type as cardtype form customer c, CardsType where c.cardtyeId = d.id and c.issueDate < sysdf

2- SQL schema to create 1-n and n-n relation DB-
3- Given an employee table with id, name and managerId - Select name and manager name.
Example:
ID     NAME 	      MANAGERID
1     Hari      	
2     ManiRathnam      1
select name,manager Name
Expected result:
Hari, null
ManiRathnam, Hari

Ans I gave-
select e1.name,e2.name from employee e1, employee e2 where e1.id = e2.managerId

4- explain different types of keys in query 
5- Databese use wich data structure for indexing
6- 2NF and 3NF













Program- 
Introduction
1- Array {1,2,3,5,6,5}
	Sum = 15
	find the array index nos which will give sum 15
	
2- What would be output for below code

public class InterfaceDefaultMethodOverried implements Poet, Story {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		InterfaceDefaultMethodOverried obj = new InterfaceDefaultMethodOverried();
		obj.write(); // what is the output
	}
}

interface Poet {
	default void write() {
		System.out.println("Writting Poet.");
	}
}

interface Story {
	default void write() {
		System.out.println("Writting Story.");
	}
}







## Map vs FlatMap
	- map - transform each element to differnt value
	- FlatMap - flatten a stream of streams into a single stream.
		- concatenates all those streams into a single stream.
		EX- List<String> sentences = Arrays.asList("hello world", "java stream");
	List<String> words = sentences.stream()
                              .flatMap(sentence -> Arrays.stream(sentence.split(" ")))
                              .collect(Collectors.toList());

	System.out.println(words); // Output: [hello, world, java, stream]

## bounded context-
	- A Bounded context should be an independent domain.
	- a bounded context is a logical boundary within which a particular domain model applies. It represents a specific responsibility or domain area in your application
	-* Bounded Context is a domain driven module. One MS id for a complete domain. Like User Management, Customer management, Order management.

## CORS- Cross origin configuration
	- CORS is a frature implemented by browser to prevent web pages from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the web page
	- Spring boot configuration
		- in Configuration class	
			- @Configuration
			public class WebConfig implements WebMvcConfigurer {

				@Override
				public void addCorsMappings(CorsRegistry registry) {
					registry.addMapping("/**")
							.allowedOrigins("http://www.example.com")
							.allowedMethods("GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE", "OPTIONS")
							.allowedHeaders("*")
							.allowCredentials(true)
							.maxAge(3600);
				}
			}
	
		- in Controller class add cors annotaion
			@CrossOrigin(origins = "http://www.example.com")
	
## @Component vs @Bean (3 times asked)
 - @Component - Used to automatically detect and register beans in the Spring application context. It defined on class.
	- @Component Preferable for component scanning and automatic wiring.
	- This also define in class level
 - @Bean - Declare on single bean in @Configuration class. 
	- @Bean basicall used in Configuration class. 
	
 - When should use @Bean and @Component?
	- Let's imagine that you want to wire components from 3rd-party libraries (you don't have the source code so you can't annotate its classes with @Component), so automatic configuration is not possible. In this case we should use only @Bean
	
	
 
## How can we add external properties files in MS other than application.properties
	- We can specify the path in properties file
		spring.config.additional-location=file:/path/to/your/config/
	- we can also specify in annotation
	@Configuration
	@PropertySource("classpath:custom.properties")
	public class CustomConfig {
	  @Value("${custom.property}")
	  private String customProperty;

	  // getters and setters
	}
	
## path param, query param and request param
- Path Param 
	 - @GetMapping("/users/{userId}/orders/{orderId}")
		public Order getOrder(@PathVariable String userId, @PathVariable String orderId) {
			// Implementation here
		}
		
	- Query Parma-
	- Basicall it is used for get method - to get, search and sort etc
	- to get the request data used @RequestParam annotation
	EX-
	- /search?query=java&limit=10
	@GetMapping("/products")
	public List<Product> getProducts(@RequestParam String category, @RequestParam String sort) {
		// Implementation here
	}
	
	- Request param-
	- It basically used for POST, PUT, UPDATE method as Request body
	Ex- 
	@PostMapping("/users")
    public User createUser(@RequestBody User user) {
        // Implementation logic here
        return userService.createUser(user);
    }

## PostConstruct and EventListener method execute at time of spring boot start up
	@PostConstruct
	public void postConstruct() {
		System.out.println("@PostConstruct method called");
	}
	
	@EventListener
	public void handleContextRefresh(ContextRefreshedEvent event) {
		System.out.println("@EventListener method called");
	}
	
	- Other interfaces which called before spring boot application start up
	- CommandLineRunner, InitializingBean, ApplicationRunner 

## How you do sping boot versioning - 
	Ans - Versioning requered, when same api will called by different clients(mobile app, desktop, ..) 
	Ex- app/v1 - Mobile, app/v2  - desktop
	
	@RequestMapping(value = {"app/v1","app/v2"})  // it will take both requests
	//you can write get put and post methods
	// if you want particular request use request.getUri()
