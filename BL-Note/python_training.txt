List comprshion

Create Telecom Applications using Python Object Oriented Programming features. Application should have Constructor Class , Customer Class, Telecom Employee Class . Use Inheritance Concept to implement Telecom Application.

Create fibonance sequecnce
factorial of n no


for loop, while loop iteration
if, elif, else
parallel assignment
variable argument
list, touple, dict

----------
function programming
Lamda, set, map, filter, sort, reverse, zip
list and dictonary comprshion
Object oriented programming

---------------
Bult-In Functions:
lambda —> It is used to create anonymous function
Map —> first parameter is function and second parameter is any number of arguments
List —> first parameter is function and second parameter is one argument
Set —> if we use set for a list of records, it will remove duplicate and also it will be unordered
Set Methods —> intersection, union, add

Python is a interpreter language
Loop - for loop, while loop  and its iteration
Condition block - if, elif, else

----------------
Process - a execution is process
GIL - Global Interpreter Lock
	Limits threading operation
	parallel execution restricted
	Ensure only one thred execution
	in the intepreter only one

CPU base parallel - multi process
I/O based parallel - threading

Disadvantage
- GIL
- complexity
- race condition
- debugging

Adv
- Isolation -
- multiple thread

Locks - Mutex - only one thread can access at one time
Semaphores - 
Condition Variable - waiting thread

concurrency.threadPool
concurrency controll

pytest
command to run
pytest file.py -v  // give details of the test
pytest file.py -q
pytest file.py::testmethod  // only one menthod
- pytest give a report of all the test case in a folder

pytest allows marker
marker allow to look for a specific test
marker are apllied 

pytest -m great .\test_compare_copy.py -v

pytest -m great .\test_compare_copy.py -v

pytest -m great .\test_compare*.py -v


------- 
fixture
future are function which will run before each test function to which applied

pytest -k divisible -v

flask
jinja2 template in html code {{% for..}}
sqlalchemy  - orm provides to connect any database
pip install --upgrade flask_sqlalchemy

DB - sqlite3 - inbuild in python(like h2 db in springboot)

--
flask insrallation
created get api using flask
Createed Jinja2 template in html for UI page
send data from api to html and render through render_template 
used condition and iterate data jinja2 template
connected to data base sqlite using sqlalchemy
Create table, insert data, read data from table

-----
Driver to connect postgress db
	pip install psycopg2-binary

Updae pip
	pip install ––upgrade pip
	
python -m pip install —upgrade pip

CREATE TABLE services (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    customer_id INTEGER REFERENCES customers(id) NOT NULL
);

select * from services;

-----------
Flask Blueprints
	organize flask app into small resuable components
	create a modula structure
	
	ddfine groups of routes
	templates
	static files
	
register buleprints
	from.auth.views import auth_bp
	
modularity
seperation of concern
scalability


1. Worked on the connection between Postgres and .py files
2. Creating the tables and inserting the records into table to Postgres DB
3. Customer CRUD operations (GET, POST) 
4. How to create the directory structure

capstone project
user manageemtnt
user manageemtnt - Authentication, login, logout, user roles
plans and submission - Create, edit, delete telecom plans
Subscription manageemtnt
Billing and payment
Customer support
Reporting analutics
Security and compliance


Decorators
Special function which adds additional functionaliy
Ex- Basic model car, you add new feature like change color, add aloy wheel
