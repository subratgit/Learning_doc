Go- Language
- It is on premises support
- Python - thread was global interprter lock 
- Go complies to machine code  - better performance
- easy to read and write
- used for block chang and cryptocurrency
- Versatility, performance, simplicity


Variable
	define var keyword
	var age int
	age = 30
Constants 
	const keyword 
	can not modify
	const pi = 3.14
int: integer type int, int8, int 16
float  - flot16
byte- uint8
rune - alias fo int 32

var a, b int = 10,5

No Polymerphism and inheritance

function syntax
func <function_name>(arg int) int8/*return type*/ {

}

//diclare variable
var a := 10


Control Structure--
if condition--
	if age >= 18 {
		fmt.Println("--")
	}

Loop - for, while(NO KEY word as while), infinite loop

Array , slices, Maps
Array - fixed size collection of elements of same type
Ex - var arrayname [size] datatype
	len(arrayName)

Slices
Slice is dynamic
flexible length
Ex - sliceName []datatype
sliceName := make([]datatype, length, capacity)
for i, range(sliceName)

Maps
Map is unordered collection key-value pair
var mapName map[keyType] value


1- Golang History and advantages
2- datatypes
3- variable declarations
4- condition statements - if, else if, switch
5- Method declarations, multiple method argument and multiple retun types
6- loop- for, while 
7- DS- Array, Slice

day2--
Map
Error handling
exclipit error handling
panic and recovery for exception

panic - critical error
recover - to regain control of panicking goroutine
deffer - gressfully recover error - same as finally

pointer
pointer store memory adress of another variable
declare pointer is *oprator

deferencing pointer - Accessing the value stored in memory location
Ex-
var x int =10
var ptr *int = &x // ptr points the memory address of x
fmt.Proint(*ptr) // prints the value of x through ptr

Memory Allocation
It managed in runtime
fratures - garbage collection, reclaim memory no longer used

Heap - objects are stored

Escape Analysis
determine whether variables can allocated on the stack or they promoted to heap

pass by value and pass by refernce
passing pointer or address is pass by refernce

memeory safety

dangling pointers - pointer which are not used
- not pointing to any valid objects

Struct- composite datatype
	- define by type
	Ex-
	type Person struct {
		name string
	}
Create instance of stack
p := Person{name:"Alice"}

Interfaces
	- set of method signatures
	- used keyword type
	
	Ex- 
	type Shape interface {
	 area() float64
	 }
	 
	 - declare methods in interface
	 Ex- 
	 func (c Circle) area() float64 {
	 return 3.14 * c.radius
	 }
	 
	 - Circle is struct - radius is defined here

Method
Methods are function associated with a particular type
- associated to additional receiver praram before function name

1- Golang History and advantages
2- datatypes
3- variable declarations
4- condition statements - if, else if, switch
5- Method declarations, multiple method argument and multiple retun types
6- loop- for, while 
7- DS- Array, Slice
8- Map
9- struct, interface
10- pointer
11- file handeling
12- Exception Handling - predefine and custom exception

Goroutine
- Goroutines are lightweight thread
Ex-
go func(){
}

Channels -
communication mechanism used to synchtonize data between goroutine
facilitate safe communication
Ex-
ch :=make(chan int)
go func(){
	ch <-42 // send datat to channel
}()

value := <-ch //receive data from channel

Concurrency Patterns
fan-out / fan-in
fan-out - distributes workload 
fan-in - result collected 
	waits for all the subtask to complete the task and collect

Context-
provides mechanism for handeling deadlines, Cancellations timeouts in concurrent operations

Mutes - mutual exclusion
-lock()
-unlocl()

RWMutex - extesion of Mutex
- multiple read and only one write
- Lock()  and Rlock()

Points-

Goroutine- for multiple thread
Channel- message pass from different threads
Concurrency
Context
Select statement- to select one thread
Mutex, RWMutex, lock(), unLock(), defer()
WaitGroup, wait add(), wait done()
Fan out and Fan in

Day4-
Testing--
- file should be _test.go
- fuction start with Test
Ex- 
func testAdd(t *testing.T){
	result := Add(2,3)
	if resule !=5 {
		t.Errorf("Add(2,3)= %d; want 5", result)
		
	}
	}
t.Error* - report error and continue execution
t.Fatal* - return the error and stop execution

-- to run test case command in terminal
go test -v
go test -v <test file>


Table-Driven test---
Test difine multiple tests in slice of structure


Subtest - group related tests togather
Benchmark test - it support for performance test
	Benchmark*
Coverage - support test coverage
	go test -cover
	go test -coverprofile=coveragefilename.out
	
Mocking and dependecy injection ---

Gin framework -
go get -u github.com/gin-gonic/gin

go get github.com/pkg/profile
go mod tidy

Sumary of golang test 
1- File and method naming convension
2- Test method signature
3- different commands to run different type of test cases
4- Table-Driven test - basicaly its like bulk test
4- Subtest - it is group of related test cases
5- Benchmark test - it is for system resource and performance test
6- Coverage test - it is for to check code coverage test. check the percetage of line covered by test cases
7- Mocking - Mock objects
8- Stated on gin framework

Gin----
Gin gonic-
Git frame written in go lang itself
- this is light weight and faster
- Build on top of FASTHTTP package
	- High performer http server

Routing- Http request and handler fuction

Git support middle wire support
Middle wire - Logging, Authentication

Gin provides error handeling

What is a purpose of GIN framework ?
Gin framework is web framework for Go lang. It is developed using go lang. It provides high performance and error handeling features.

Explain quickly about router services-
Router server is part of gin framework, it provides differnt types of routing like GET, POST, PUT, Delete

postgre sql driver-
