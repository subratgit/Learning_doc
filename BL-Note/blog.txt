I have pointed to few growth.
 Does we need everything in our life?
 
Why this question came to my mind?
	Most motivational speakers and Career influencer says growth in your life. Ultimately their soul meaning is to go up in property / asset growth. I think there is no use of property if you dont enjoy that. Simply if you collect property for your kids then what they will do. They should also think about hard work and their progress.
	
	Yes, we need our property growth, 
	 - to show up in socity that I am rich person. Because socity also respect rich person. But for me this for certain age you might enjoy this. 
	 - to have secure future life. As working in private job and belongs to middle class category, will not get any support from goverment eventhough providing huge tax from my hard earn money. We are working in private sector, having lot work pressure and stress. Compermising on Kids care. Still we all are doubtfull for future job
	 
	 


Should focus on
	- Work life balance
	- Happiness
	- Well health
	- Provide a good behaviour and manner to your kids
		- Teach how to handel this socity.Shold not more soft should not more hard
		- dareness and taking risk skill
	- Work for your safiscaction/happliness not always for money
