Here are some core Java interview questions that are suitable for someone with 10 years of experience:





22- What is the difference between fail-fast and fail-safe iterators?


24- How does the HashMap work internally?

25- What is the difference between HashMap and HashTable?

26- Explain the concept of synchronization and thread-safety in the context of collections.

27- What is the purpose of the java.util.concurrent package? Give an example of a concurrent collection class.

28- How does the ConcurrentHashMap achieve thread-safety and high concurrency?

29- What is the difference between CopyOnWriteArrayList and ArrayList in terms of concurrency?

30- Can you explain the concept of Comparator and Comparable interfaces?

31- What is the difference between intermediate and terminal operations on Stream?

32- What does the peek() method do? When should you use it?
	The peek() method is useful for debugging or monitoring purposes. It allows you to inspect the elements of a stream at various points during the stream pipeline without affecting the pipeline's behavior or the final result. You can use it to perform operations such as printing the elements, logging information, or updating external variables.

33- What do you mean by saying Stream is lazy? 
	They will not work by just including them on the Stream pipeline. They works on demand

34- What is the difference between the findFirst() and findAny() method? which use when?
	The findFirst() method will return the first element meeting the criterion i.e. Predicate, while the findAny() method will return any element meeting the criterion, very useful while working with a parallel stream.

35- 









Synchronized / Thread safe / One thread work
	- Vector, HashTable, CopyOnWriteArraylist, StringBuffer

Not Synchronized / Not Thread safe / Multiple thread work at a same time
	- ArrayList, HashMap, StringBuilder

                        return Optional.of("Even");
                    } else {
                        return Optional.empty();
                    }
